    "bioText":"I am a junior developer on his way through classes taken at the Code Fellows Academy. I used to be a professional scuba diver by trade and it was a really fun job, but babysitting adults was not something I wanted to do full-time. I am a big gamer and I acquired an HTC Vive one day; a gift from my father. I began playing the simple games that were already out and became heavily addicted to Fruit Ninja for the VR. I began thinking that instead of just playing games, maybe I could become a part of the industry that creates games and refines the VR systems. Thus, I began taking classes at Code Fellows. I admit, it\'s been a bumpy ride, but it\'s also been really fun. Time goes by really fast, which is both a blessing and a curse. I\'ve made so many new friends andbeen able to both share my own ideas, and learn new ones. I hope to eventually bring one of my all-time favorite games to the VR world and eventually to a holographic industry; the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game. Hopefully, I'll be on my way there sooner than later, and I hope to continue experiencing the awesome encounters with people and tech.",
